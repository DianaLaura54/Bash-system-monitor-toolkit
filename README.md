This bash scripting toolkit provides a comprehensive suite of system administration and monitoring tools through an interactive command-line interface. It monitors system resources in real-time, analyzes log files using advanced text processing (awk, sed, grep), manages running processes, and generates professional reports in multiple formats. The toolkit includes automated backup functionality, service health checking, and configurable alert systems. Users can track CPU, memory, and disk usage with color-coded visual displays, search and analyze system logs for errors and patterns, and manage system processes with safety confirmations. All features are accessible through a user-friendly dashboard menu that connects eight specialized tools for complete system administration capabilities.
